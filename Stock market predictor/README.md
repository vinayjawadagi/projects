This project predicts stock price using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Markov models. The encompasses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, including summary statistics, visualization, seasonal decomposition, and stationarity checks, to gain insights into the underlying patterns and characteristics of the data. The primary focus is on utilizing the closing price column for predictive modeling, justified by its significance in reflecting market sentiment, liquidity, consistency, technical analysis, and modeling stability. The implementation of rolling statistics further enhances trend identification by smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The findings from the EDA process inform the subsequent modeling and evaluation stages, facilitating informed decision-making and forecasting in the stock market domain.
